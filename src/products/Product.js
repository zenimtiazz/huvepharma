    <p className='para'>Hostazym® P is an E.coli derived 6-phytase, produced by the yeast Pichia pastoris in a submerged fermentation process. Hostazym® P has been developed by researchers of the Cornell university in the USA and bears some specific selected features. Hostazym® P is particularly effective in animal diets because it works optimal at a broad pH range, between pH 1 and 5. Further Hostazym® is rather insensitive for degradation by pepsin, which is a naturally present (an endogenous) enzyme produced in the stomach of animals and which can destroy phytase. Hostazym® P is also much faster than other phytases in releasing Phosphorus from its indigestable form phytate, the natural form in which most of the phosphorus is stored in grains and seeds.</p>
